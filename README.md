# ArduinoRGB
This algorithim improves upon the sample code in lesson 4 "RGB LED" of the elegoo guide for the Mega 2560 microcontroller.
This utilizes recursion to cut back on the size of the code from 2180 bytes of memory to 1924 bytes of memory. 
It should be noted that recursion has no speed or efficiency benefits over the standard "if" statments, but it does allow for an improvment in readability.
